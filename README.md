Your system is 103.78 libyears behind
```

## Example 1
For example, a rails 5.0.0 dependency (released June 30, 2016) is roughly 1 libyear behind the 5.1.2 version (released June 26, 2017).

## Simpler is Better
There are obviously more nuanced ways to calculate dependency freshness. The advantage of this approach is its simplicity. You will be able to explain this calculation to your colleagues in about 30s.

## Example 2
If your system has two dependencies, the first one year old, the second three, then your system is four libyears out-of-date.

## A Healthy App
Apps below 10 libyears are considered to be healthy apps. We regularly rescue projects that are over 100 libyears behind.

## Etymology
"lib" is short for "library", the most common form of dependency.

## Development

To develop this library, follow this process:

1. Fork and clone this repository
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r test_requirements.txt .`
1. Run tests: `pytest`

Also see `.github/workflows/pythonpackage.yml` for other steps taken during testing.
